# MessageExplorer
My XrmToolBox plugin to view all messages/triggers in Dynamics 365 and the workflows and plugin steps registered for them

Plugin requires that you are connected to an organization.
Upon load all entities, messages/triggers and subscribers are loaded, this makes initial load a tad slow.
After load everything should run smoothly, except for being designed by a windows forms amateur.

A lot of plans for extending this plugin, please add feature requests as you see fit
